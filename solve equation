% Define the third-order differential equation
syms u(x)
ode = diff(u,x,3) == u;

% Define the initial conditions
cond1 = u(0) == 1;
cond2 = diff(u,x)(0) == -1;
cond3 = diff(u,x,2)(0) == pi;
conds = [cond1 cond2 cond3];

% Solve the differential equation with the given initial conditions
sol = dsolve(ode, conds);
